## About

Using the OpenWeather API, I created a functioning weather dashboard that displays the current weather of any searched city. A 5-day forecast will also be displayed for searched cities and the searched cities will be set to local storage, creating a list of recently searched cities. The HTML is a very basic card structure. The was also attempted by looping through JS, but I was able to use more proper information through creating cards in Bootstrap.
